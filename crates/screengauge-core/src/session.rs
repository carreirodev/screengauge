//! The session core: everything that happens between calling ScreenGauge and closing the tools (v1 spec WPC-296,
//! Modules). It is the spec's test point, chosen by the owner on 2026-10-29.
//!
//! The Windows layer opens a [`Session`] with the frozen screen, the options and the remembered state, hands it every
//! [`Event`] while the tools are open, draws its [`Scene`] and carries out the [`Effect`]s it returns. The session
//! never calls Windows and never reads the clock: the local time comes with each event.
